## Current gate

Mandatory checkpoint 2: review the completed local Strands workflow before web or AWS work.

## Latest evidence

- Tests: `uv run pytest` — 29 passed; the explicitly opt-in live-provider test skipped.
- Lint: `uv run ruff check .` and `uv run ruff format --check .` — passed.
- Type checking: `uv run pyright` — 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 informations.
- Demo command or URL: `uv run asset-shepherd agent-run fixtures/broken_robot.glb --profile
  profiles/unreal_indie_robot.json --output agent-demo-output --decision approve
  --offline-scripted`.
- Generated artifacts: the exact seven-file deterministic ZIP plus external `job_result.json` and
  structured `agent_result.json` with metrics.

## Blockers

None.

## Next action

Stop at mandatory checkpoint 2. Do not begin M8 web or M9 AWS work until review.
