# Asset Shepherd

Asset Shepherd is an autonomous 3D-asset intake, inspection, repair-planning, and
verification agent for game developers.

> [!NOTE]
> This repository is an early hackathon work in progress.

## Project control

## Deterministic CLI demo

```powershell
uv sync
uv run asset-shepherd run fixtures/broken_robot.glb `
  --profile profiles/unreal_indie_robot.json `
  --approvals examples/approve_normalization.json `
  --output demo-output
```

The command inspects, plans, applies policy-safe renames, consumes the explicit normalization
approval, repairs, independently verifies, and writes `demo-output/result.zip`. It does not invoke a
model or make a network request.
